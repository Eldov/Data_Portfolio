Starting Project 3, a little bit simpler.  
The Cloud to be used will be AWS and IaC Terraform;  
As Data Source, I will create a database in Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) where we will have a table to ingest from;  
I will use AWS DMS (Database Migration Service) to ingest from our RDS;  
As the project will be made as a Data Lake, Amazon S3 is the pick for storage;  
Processing will be done by running Spark scripts through Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce);  
I will load the data using Amazon Glue/Athena;  
Management will be done using AWS Cost Explorer;  
At the end there will be an example of a Data Warehouse using Amazon Redshift.
