### **The Project 1** <br/> 
This "project", if I can really call it this way, has a quite simple goal: </br>
With a small table, answer the same 5 questions using what I know in different languages/tools


*Read this in another language: [Português](https://github.com/Eldov/Projects/blob/main/Project%201/README.pt-br.md)*

### **Data/Table** <br/>
The table includes data on 100 properties in a disregarded location. The attributes are:</br>
Imoveis (Properties), IPTU (Brazilian Tax), Area - M², IPTU / M² and Classificações (Rating or Class). </br>
The rating is made according to the IPTU value per M²  where:
Rating will appear as "Nobre" (High) - with values of the IPTU / M² ratio greater than R$38.00, "Média" (Average) - with values between R$25.00 and R$38.00 e "Popular" (Low) when falling under R$25.00.

### **Questions** <br/>
The 5 proposed questions to be answered in the most varied ways are:
1) What is the most common area rating?
2) What is the average property tax in the "Nobre" area?
3) What is the total property tax for the "Média" area?
4) Assuming that the operational value for IPTU receipts is null, how much more would the tax authority receive if all properties were classified as "Média"?
5) What are the maximum and minimum values of IPTU, Area and IPTU/M² and their respective properties?

### **Tools** <br/>
My goal is to answer these questions using different tools to test my knowledge.
So far, I intend to answer by the following means:

1) Excel;
2) VBA;
3) SQL;
4) Python;
5) Pandas;
6) PowerBI <br/>

Thus, I want to test my most basic skills and put into practice/remember previously learned content.
