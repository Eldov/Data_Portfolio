//Something's off... I am getting the same values of 'Monthly Active Sellers'.
//They should indeed be similar numbers but what I am getting is that no one made, in a month, more than 25 sales and less than the total days on that very month.
//It also indicates that everyone that sold more than 25 times in a month, did so at least daily. That is unlikely.
//These are the numbers, monthly, of sellers, that sold, in average, once per day every month.
//A solution could be create a new table/view/subquery with all the days in the year of 2017,
//join with the orders to create days with 0 orders. The days would remove the seller. Tried creating suck but failed. This was the best I could get.
